This is an html parser for mindat.org mineral pages ex:https://www.mindat.org/min-3026.html\n
It will produce a csv with selected attributes similar to the searchable properties in Wut R Rox.
Some manual editing of the output is required for Wut R Rox to be effective, most notable: breaking cleavage into cleavage quality,
angle, and number of directions. Filling in some blank spaces with information from wikipedia and other sources is also required.
